Vi is a linux text editor that is preinstalled. It is important to know its basics as your OS, 
e.g. docker containers does not contain more intuitive editors like nano, 
or some applications like git merge conflicts exclusively use `vi` to save ur changes.

- `vi <file-name>`: open file
- `i`: (insert) enable editing mode
- `:wq`: (write-quit) write your changes and quit
- `:q`: quite without changes
- `:q!`: force quit
